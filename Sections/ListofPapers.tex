%From Lyubas Thesis:
% The authors had the following contributions:
% Thomas Brochier designed, set up and performed the experiment and wrote the manuscript. Lyuba Zehl designed and performed the data and metadata management of the experiment, developed and implemented the data and metadata loading and pre-processing routines, wrote the manuscript and designed the corresponding figures. Yaoyao Hao performed the experiment, helped with technical issues of the experimental setup and provided valuable feedback for the manuscript. Margaux Duret was involved in setting up and performing the experiment and corresponding pre-processing steps, and provided valuable feedback for the manuscript. Julia Sprenger was involved in implementing experimental pre-processing steps, supported the implementation of the data and metadata loading routines, and provided valuable feedback for the manuscript. Michael Denker provided valuable feedback for the data and metadata management, was involved in implementing the data and metadata loading routines, and provided valuable feedback for the manuscript.
