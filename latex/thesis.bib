	abstract = {While oscillations of the local field potential (LFP) are commonly attributed to the synchronization of neuronal firing rate on the same time scale, their relationship to coincident spiking in the millisecond range is unknown. Here, we present experimental evidence to reconcile the notions of synchrony at the level of spiking and at the mesoscopic scale. We demonstrate that only in time intervals of significant spike synchrony that cannot be explained on the basis of firing rates, coincident spikes are better phase locked to the LFP than predicted by the locking of the individual spikes. This effect is enhanced in periods of large LFP amplitudes. A quantitative model explains the LFP dynamics by the orchestrated spiking activity in neuronal groups that contribute the observed surplus synchrony. From the correlation analysis, we infer that neurons participate in different constellations but contribute only a fraction of their spikes to temporally precise spike configurations. This finding provides direct evidence for the hypothesized relation that precise spike synchrony constitutes a major temporally and spatially organized component of the LFP.},

Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.

Findings
Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

	abstract = {A major hurdle in brain-machine interfaces (BMI) is the lack of an implantable neural interface system that remains viable for a substantial fraction of the user's lifetime. Recently, sub-mm implantable, wireless electromagnetic (EM) neural interfaces have been demonstrated in an effort to extend system longevity. However, EM systems do not scale down in size well due to the severe inefficiency of coupling radio-waves at those scales within tissue. This paper explores fundamental system design trade-offs as well as size, power, and bandwidth scaling limits of neural recording systems built from low-power electronics coupled with ultrasonic power delivery and backscatter communication. Such systems will require two fundamental technology innovations: (1) 10-100 $\mu$m scale, free-floating, independent sensor nodes, or neural dust, that detect and report local extracellular electrophysiological data via ultrasonic backscattering and (2) a sub-cranial ultrasonic interrogator that establishes power and communication links with the neural dust. We provide experimental verification that the predicted scaling effects follow theory; (127 $\mu$m)(3) neural dust motes immersed in water 3 cm from the interrogator couple with 0.002064\% power transfer efficiency and 0.04246 ppm backscatter, resulting in a maximum received power of \~{}0.5 $\mu$W with \~{}1 nW of change in backscatter power with neural activity. The high efficiency of ultrasonic transmission can enable the scaling of the sensing nodes down to 10s of micrometer. We conclude with a brief discussion of the application of neural dust for both central and peripheral nervous system recordings, and perspectives on future research directions.},

Here we describe a neurophysiological paradigm for performing tethered and wireless large-scale recordings based on movable volumetric three-dimensional (3D) multielectrode implants. This approach allowed us to isolate up to 1,800 neurons (units) per animal and simultaneously record the extracellular activity of close to 500 cortical neurons, distributed across multiple cortical areas, in freely behaving rhesus monkeys. The method is expandable, in principle, to thousands of simultaneously recorded channels. It also allows increased recording longevity (5 consecutive years) and recording of a broad range of behaviors, such as social interactions, and BMI paradigms in freely moving primates. We propose that wireless large-scale recordings could have a profound impact on basic primate neurophysiology research while providing a framework for the development and testing of clinically relevant neuroprostheses.},

We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution.

The use of metadata in Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs) to curate experiment data is an essential ingredient for facilitating discovery. The University of Southampton has developed a Web browser-based ELN that enables users to add their own metadata to notebook entries. A survey of these notebooks was completed to assess user behavior and patterns of metadata usage within ELNs, while user perceptions and expectations were gathered through interviews and user-testing activities within the community. The findings indicate that while some groups are comfortable with metadata and are able to design a metadata structure that works effectively, many users are making little attempts to use it, thereby endangering their ability to recover data in the future. A survey of patterns of metadata use in these notebooks, together with feedback from the user community, indicated that while a few groups are comfortable with metadata and are able to design a metadata structure that works effectively, many users adopt a {\textquotedblleft}minimum required{\textquotedblright} approach to metadata. To investigate whether the patterns of metadata use in LabTrove were unusual, a series of surveys were undertaken to investigate metadata usage in a variety of platforms supporting user-defined metadata. These surveys also provided the opportunity to investigate whether interface designs in these other environments might inform strategies for encouraging metadata creation and more effective use of metadata in LabTrove.},

In the last 10 years neuroscience spawned quantitative datasets of unprecedented breadth (e.g., microanatomy, synaptic connections, and optogenetic brain-behavior assays) and size (e.g., cognition, brain imaging, and genetics). While growing data availability and information granularity have been amply discussed, we direct attention to a less explored question: How will the unprecedented data richness shape data analysis practices? Statistical reasoning is becoming more important to distill neurobiological knowledge from healthy and pathological brain measurements.

	abstract = {To date, non-reproducibility of neurophysiological research is a matter of intense discussion in the scientific community. A crucial component to enhance reproducibility is to comprehensively collect and store metadata, that is all information about the experiment, the data, and the applied preprocessing steps on the data, such that they can be accessed and shared in a consistent and simple manner. However, the complexity of experiments, the highly specialized analysis workflows and a lack of knowledge on how to make use of supporting software tools often overburden researchers to perform such a detailed documentation. For this reason, the collected metadata are often incomplete, incomprehensible for outsiders or ambiguous. Based on our research experience in dealing with diverse datasets, we here provide conceptual and technical guidance to overcome the challenges associated with the collection, organization, and storage of metadata in a neurophysiology laboratory. Through the concrete example of managing the metadata of a complex experiment that yields multi-channel recordings from monkeys performing a behavioral motor task, we practically demonstrate the implementation of these approaches and solutions with the intention that they may be generalized to a specific project at hand. Moreover, we detail five use cases that demonstrate the resulting benefits of constructing a well-organized metadata collection when processing or analyzing the recorded data, in particular when these are shared between laboratories in a modern scientific collaboration. Finally, we suggest an adaptable workflow to accumulate, structure and store metadata from different sources using, by way of example, the odML metadata framework.},

If these activities are well organized and supported by a suitable infrastructure, work efficiency of researchers increases significantly.This article deals with the main concepts, design, and development of software and hardware infrastructure for research in electrophysiology. The described infrastructure has been primarily developed for the needs of neuroinformatics laboratory at the University of West Bohemia, the Czech Republic. However, from the beginning it has been also designed and developed to be open and applicable in laboratories that do similar research.After introducing the laboratory and the whole architectural concept the individual parts of the infrastructure are described. The central element of the software infrastructure is a web-based portal that enables community researchers to store, share, download and search data and metadata from electrophysiological experiments. The data model, domain ontology and usage of semantic web languages and technologies are described. Current data publication policy used in the portal is briefly introduced. The registration of the portal within Neuroscience Information Framework is described. Then the methods used for processing of electrophysiological signals are presented. The specific modifications of these methods introduced by laboratory researches are summarized; the methods are organized into a laboratory workflow. Other parts of the software infrastructure include mobile and offline solutions for data/metadata storing and a hardware stimulator communicating with an EEG amplifier and recording software.},

Forming categories is fundamental to cognition9 and can be independent of a {\textquoteleft}memory store{\textquoteright} of information about the items or a prototype10. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the formation of categories are unknown. Using an animal model of category learning6, in which frequency-modulated tones are distinguished into the categories of {\textquoteleft}rising{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}falling{\textquoteright} modulation, we demonstrate here that the sorting of stimuli into these categories emerges as a sudden change in an animal's learning strategy. Electro-corticographical recording from the auditory cortex11 shows that the transition is accompanied by a change in the dynamics of cortical stimulus representation. We suggest that this dynamic change represents a mechanism underlying the recognition of the abstract quality (or qualities) that defines the categories.},

However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the {\textquotedblright}Open metaData Markup Language{\textquotedblright} (od ML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In od ML arbitrary metadata informa- tion is stored as extended key-value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to od ML is a clear separation of format and content, i.e. neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes od ML flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly with- out the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in od ML terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the od ML format can be integrated into the labora- tory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of od ML also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists use many different software tools to acquire, analyse and visualise electrophysiological signals. However, incompatible data models and file formats make it difficult to exchange data between these tools. This reduces scientific productivity, renders potentially useful analysis methods inaccessible and impedes collaboration between labs.A common representation of the core data would improve interoperability and facilitate data-sharing.To that end, we propose here a language-independent object model, named "Neo", suitable for representing data acquired from electroencephalographic, intracellular, or extracellular recordings, or generated from simulations. As a concrete instantiation of this object model we have developed an open source implementation in the Python programming language.In addition to representing electrophysiology data in memory for the purposes of analysis and visualisation, the Python implementation provides a set of input/output (IO) modules for reading/writing the data from/to a variety of commonly used file formats.Support is included for formats produced by most of the major manufacturers of electrophysiology recording equipment and also for more generic formats such as MATLAB.Data representation and data analysis are conceptually separate: it is easier to write robust analysis code if it is focused on analysis and relies on an underlying package to handle data representation.For that reason, and also to be as lightweight as possible, the Neo object model and the associated Python package are deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualisation.Software for neurophysiology data analysis and visualisation built on top of Neo automatically gains the benefits of interoperability, easier data sharing and automatic format conversion; there is already a burgeoning ecosystem of such tools. We intend that Neo should become the standard basis for Python tools in neurophysiology.},

	abstract = {Abstract Repeated precise sequences of spikes are largely considered a signature of activation of cell assemblies. These repeated sequences are commonly known under the name of spatio-temporal patterns (STPs). STPs are hypothesized to play a role in the communication of information in the computational process operated by the cerebral cortex. A variety of statistical methods for the detection of STPs have been developed and applied to electrophysiological recordings, but such methods scale poorly with the current size of available parallel spike train recordings (more than 100 neurons). In this work, we introduce a novel method capable to overcome the computational and statistical limits of existing analysis techniques in detecting repeating STPs within massively parallel spike trains (MPST). We employ advanced data mining techniques to efficiently extract repeating sequences of spikes from the data. Then, we introduce and compare two alternative approaches to distinguish statistically surprising patterns from chance sequences. The first approach uses a measure known as conceptual stability, of which we investigate a computationally cheap approximation for applications to such large data sets. The second approach is based on the evaluation of pattern statistical significance. In particular, we provide an extension to STPs of a method we recently introduced for the evaluation of statistical significance of synchronous spike patterns. The performance of the two approaches is evaluated in terms of computational load and statistical power on a variety of artificial data sets that replicate specific features of experimental data. Both methods provide an effective and robust procedure for detection of STPs in MPST data. The method based on significance evaluation shows the best overall performance, although at a higher computational cost. We name the novel procedure the spatio-temporal Spike PAttern Detection and Evaluation SPADE analysis.},

	abstract = {As neuroscientists, we are obligated to guarantee the reliability of our research workflows and results.For this reason, most neuroscientific, peer-reviewed journals require, besides a full description of thenew scientific findings and used methods, at least also a brief summary of the used data. For a completelyopen scientific inquiry and to further promote scientific progress as required by most nationalfunding agencies, it would be best to share the raw data along with an analysis paper or independentlyas a standalone data publication. Unfortunately, especially the neuroscientific community ishesitant to share own research data with third parties, because guidelines, tools and support for thepublishing authors to provide data and corresponding adequate information on the experiment aregenerally hard to formalize and often missing. As a consequence, published scientific results remainunreproducible by other researchers. Along an example of a complex electrophysiological experimentwhich was conducted by external collaboration partners, I will demonstrate how to share and publishdata, but also identify the reasons why researchers, in particular experimentalists in electrophysiology,are hesitant to try the same. For this, I first provide a data descriptor of the experiment following theguidelines of a pure data journal from the Nature publishing group, called Scientific Data. Accordingto the journal guidelines, I describe all information necessary to be able to understand the setupand workflow of the experiment as well as the minimum information necessary to be able to workwith the corresponding datasets. The latter requires the provision of a robust data loading routine.To guarantee the access to the data of the experiment, I implemented a commonly usable loadingroutine for the data formats of the used data acquisition (DAQ) system from Blackrock Microsystems(Cerebus DAQ), and published it as part of an open source data framework, called Neo. Neo hasthe advantage of representing data in standardized structures that allow researchers to use commonanalysis routines on different data formats. In addition, it is possible to further annotate the Neo datastructures with experiment-specific information on the data. To automatically integrate such information,termed metadata, it is best to have them organised in a machine-readable format. Althoughseveral software solutions for such metadata formats exist, they are usually not tested for complexuse cases, such as the example experiment. In most cases, they only provide the framework itself as astandardized metadata representation or specification, and no solutions for how to actually compile auseful metadata collection. For the example experiment, I chose a metadata framework, called openmetadata Markup Language (odML), an open source project developed by the German Node (GNode)of the International Neuroinformatics Coordination Facility (INCF). In the second part of thethesis, I demonstrate how to organize metadata for the experiment, to be able to compile and use acorresponding odML metadata collection. To facilitate the compilation process for my collaborators, Ideveloped a Python package, called odMLtables, which facilitates the access to the odML frameworkby an algorithmic transformation of odML into a spreadsheet format (csv or xls) and back. In addition,I provided a complete workflow for collecting and storing the metadata of the experiment intoa comprehensive odML-file collection. Furthermore, I provided a specified data loading routine thatautomatically annotates the data structures with the corresponding metadata of the collection. Thelatter improves the workflow in the course of neuroscientific analyses of the data from the exampleexperiment, as demonstrated in the last part of my thesis. In summary, I show that the preparationsto properly share research data within a scientific collaboration are cumbersome and time consuming,but essential for successfully publishing data and analysis results for a broader audience of users. Topromote data sharing within the neuroscientific community and to provide a better foundation forreproducible research, my thesis offers a coherent strategy for managing electrophysiological data andmetadata using a well selected set of available technologies},

The primary challenge of this method is removing an electrical artifact from the MEA signals that is caused by the imaging laser. Here we show that artifact removal can be achieved with a simple filtering scheme. As a demonstration of this technique we compare large-scale local field potential signals to single-neuron activity in a small-scale group of cells recorded from rat acute slices under two conditions: suppressed vs. intact inhibitory interactions between neurons.},

The resulting data rates require reproducible analysis pipelines that are reliable, fully automated, and scalable to datasets generated over the course of months. We present CaImAn, an open-source library for calcium imaging data analysis. CaImAn provides automatic and scalable methods to address problems common to pre-processing, including motion correction, neural activity identification, and registration across different sessions of data collection. It does this while requiring minimal user intervention, with good scalability on computers ranging from laptops to high-performance computing clusters. CaImAn is suitable for two-photon and one-photon imaging, and also enables real-time analysis on streaming data. To benchmark the performance of CaImAn we collected and combined a corpus of manual annotations from multiple labelers on nine mouse two-photon datasets. We demonstrate that CaImAn achieves near-human performance in detecting locations of active neurons.},

In the areas of computational neuroscience and systems biology there are multiple model definition formats, which have contributed strongly to the development of an ecosystem of simulation and analysis tools. Here we report the development of the Neuroscience Simulation Data Format (NSDF) which extends this ecosystem to the data generated in simulations. NSDF is designed to store simulator output across scales: from multiscale chemical and electrical signaling models, to detailed single-neuron and network models, to abstract neural nets. It is self-documenting, efficient, modular, and scalable, both in terms of novel data types and in terms of data volume. NSDF is simulator-independent, and can be used by a range of standalone analysis and visualization tools. It may also be used to store variety of experimental data. NSDF is based on the widely used HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) specification and is open, platform-independent, and portable.},

This study analyses the solutions offered by generalist scientific data repositories, i.e., repositories supporting the deposition of any type of research data. These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such repositories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset formatting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a context where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.},

However, although the amount of published data continues to grow and terms such as data deluge and big data today characterize numerous (research) initiatives, much work is still needed in the direction of publishing data in order to make them effectively discoverable, available, and reusable by others. Several barriers hinder data publishing, from lack of attribution and rewards, vague citation practices, and quality issues to a rather general lack of a data-sharing culture. Lately, data journals have overcome some of these barriers. In this study of more than 100 currently existing data journals, we describe the approaches they promote for data set description, availability, citation, quality, and open access. We close by identifying ways to expand and strengthen the data journals approach as a means to promote data set access and exploitation.},

	abstract = {The data underlying scientific papers should be accessible to researchers both now and in the future, but how best can we ensure that these data are available? Here we examine the effectiveness of four approaches to data archiving: no stated archiving policy, recommending (but not requiring) archiving, and two versions of mandating data deposition at acceptance. We control for differences between data types by trying to obtain data from papers that use a single, widespread population genetic analysis, structure. At one extreme, we found that mandated data archiving policies that require the inclusion of a data availability statement in the manuscript improve the odds of finding the data online almost 1000-fold compared to having no policy. However, archiving rates at journals with less stringent policies were only very slightly higher than those with no policy at all. We also assessed the effectiveness of asking for data directly from authors and obtained over half of the requested datasets, albeit with \~{}8 d delay and some disagreement with authors. Given the long-term benefits of data accessibility to the academic community, we believe that journal-based mandatory data archiving policies and mandatory data availability statements should be more widely adopted.{\textemdash}Vines, T.

These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. Methods and Findings We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. Conclusions We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

	abstract = {Despite the increasingly digital nature of society there are some areas of research that remain firmly rooted in the past; in this case the laboratory notebook, the last remaining paper component of an experiment. Countless electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) have been created in an attempt to digitise record keeping processes in the lab, but none of them have become a `key player' in the ELN market, due to the many adoption barriers that have been identified in previous research and further explored in the user studies presented here. The main issues identified are the cost of the current available ELNs, their ease of use (or lack of it) and their accessibility issues across different devices and operating systems. Evidence suggests that whilst scientists willingly make use of generic notebooking software, spreadsheets and other general office and scientific tools to aid their work, current ELNs are lacking in the required functionality to meet the needs of the researchers. In this paper we present our extensive research and user study results to propose an ELN built upon a pre-existing cloud notebook platform that makes use of accessible popular scientific software and semantic web technologies to help overcome the identified barriers to adoption.},

	abstract = {The whisker to barrel system in rodents has become one of the major models for the study of sensory processing. Several tens of whiskers (or vibrissae) are distributed in a regular manner on both sides of the snout. Many tactile discrimination tasks using this system need multiple contacts with more than one whisker to be solved. With the aim of mimicking those multi-whisker stimuli during electrophysiological recordings, we developed a novel mechanical stimulator composed of 24 independent multi-directional piezoelectric benders adapted to the five rows and the five caudal arcs of the rat whisker pad. The most widely used technology for producing mechanical deflections of the whiskers is based on piezoelectric benders that display a non-linear behavior when driven with high frequency input commands and, if not compensated, show high unwanted ringing at particular resonance frequencies. If not corrected, this nonlinear behavior precludes the application of high frequency deflections and the study of cortical responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. To cope with the ringing problem, a mechanical and a software based solutions have been developed. With these corrections, the upper bound of the linear range of the bender is increased to 1 kHz. This new device allows the controlled delivery of large scale natural patterns of whisker deflections characterized by rapid high frequency vibrations of multiple whiskers.},

	abstract = {Patch-clamp electrophysiology is widely used to characterize neuronal electrical phenotypes. However, there are no standard experimental conditions for in vitro whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, complicating direct comparisons between data sets. In this study, we sought to understand how basic experimental conditions differ among laboratories and how these differences might impact measurements of electrophysiological parameters. We curated the compositions of external bath solutions (artificial cerebrospinal fluid), internal pipette solutions, and other methodological details such as animal strain and age from 509 published neurophysiology articles studying rodent neurons. We found that very few articles used the exact same experimental solutions as any other, and some solution differences stem from recipe inheritance from advisor to advisee as well as changing trends over the years. Next, we used statistical models to understand how the use of different experimental conditions impacts downstream electrophysiological measurements such as resting potential and action potential width. Although these experimental condition features could explain up to 43\% of the study-to-study variance in electrophysiological parameters, the majority of the variability was left unexplained. Our results suggest that there are likely additional experimental factors that contribute to cross-laboratory electrophysiological variability, and identifying and addressing these will be important to future efforts to assemble consensus descriptions of neurophysiological phenotypes for mammalian cell types.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This article describes how using different experimental methods during patch-clamp electrophysiology impacts downstream physiological measurements. We characterized how methodologies and experimental solutions differ across articles. We found that differences in methods can explain some, but not all, of the study-to-study variance in electrophysiological measurements. Explicitly accounting for methodological differences using statistical models can help correct downstream electrophysiological measurements for cross-laboratory methodology differences.},

We can prove that higher-powered experiments can save resources in the overall research process without generating excess false positives. The better the quality of the pre-study information and its exploitation, the more likely this beneficial effect is to occur. Additionally, we quantify the adverse effects of both neglecting good practices in the design and conduct of hypotheses-based research, and the omission of the publication of {\textquoteleft}negative{\textquoteleft} findings.

	abstract = {Scientific progress requires that findings can be reproduced by other scientists. However, there is widespread debate in psychology (and other fields) about how to interpret failed replications. Many have argued that contextual factors might account for several of these failed replications. We analyzed 100 replication attempts in psychology and found that the extent to which the research topic was likely to be contextually sensitive (varying in time, culture, or location) was associated with replication success. This relationship remained a significant predictor of replication success even after adjusting for characteristics of the original and replication studies that previously had been associated with replication success (e.g., effect size, statistical power). We offer recommendations for psychologists and other scientists interested in reproducibility., In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to reproducibility. For example, the Reproducibility Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top psychology journals found that only 39\% could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical power, researcher{\textquoteright}s degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual differences (often termed {\textquotedblleft}hidden moderators{\textquotedblright}) between the original research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and consumers should be mindful of contextual factors that might influence a psychological process. We offer several guidelines for dealing with contextual sensitivity in reproducibility.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

	abstract = {At various machine learning conferences, at various times, there have been discussions arising from the inability to replicate the experimental results published in a paper. There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this prob-lem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of ex-perimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard ma-chine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount. I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally de-sirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differ-ences between the two. Reproducibility re-quires changes; replicability avoids them. Al-though reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having. 1.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent reports in neuroscience, especially those concerning brain-injury and neuroimaging, have revealed low reproducibility of results within the field and urged for more replication studies. However, it is unclear if the neuroscience journals welcome or discourage the submission of reports on replication studies. Therefore, the current study assessed the explicit position of neuroscience journals on replications. Methods: A list of active neuroscience journals publishing in English was compiled from Scopus database. These journal websites were accessed to read their aims and scope and instructions to authors, and to assess if they (1) explicitly stated that they accept replications; (2) did not state their position on replications; (3) implicitly discouraged replications by emphasizing on the novelty of the manuscripts; or (4) explicitly stated that they reject replications. For journals that explicitly stated they accept or reject replications, their subcategory within neuroscience and their 5-year impact factor were recorded. The distribution of neuroscience replication studies published was also recorded by searching and extracting data from Scopus. Results: Of the 465 journals reviewed, 28 (6.0\%) explicitly stated that they accept replications, 394 (84.7\%) did not state their position on replications, 40 (8.6\%) implicitly discouraged replications by emphasizing on the novelty of the manuscripts, and 3 (0.6\%) explicitly stated that they reject replications. For the 28 journals that explicitly welcomed replications, three (10.7\%) stated their position in the aims and scope, whereas 25 (89.3\%) stated in within the detailed instructions to authors. The five-year impact factor (2015) of these journals ranged from 1.655 to 10.799, and nine of them (32.1\%) did not receive a 5-year or annual impact factor in 2015. There was no significant difference in the proportions of journals explicitly welcomed replications (journals with versus without impact factors, or high versus low impact factors). All sub-categories of neuroscience had at least a journal that welcomed replications. Discussion: The neuroscience journals that welcomed replications and published replications were reported. These pieces of information may provide descriptive information on the current journal practices regarding replication so the evidence-based recommendations to journal publishers can be made.},

	abstract = {Beta oscillations observed in motor cortical local field potentials (LFPs) recorded on separate electrodes of a multi-electrode array have been shown to exhibit non-zero phase shifts that organize into planar waves. Here, we generalize this concept to additional classes of salient patterns that fully describe the spatial organization of beta oscillations. During a delayed reach-to-grasp task we distinguish planar, synchronized, random, circular, and radial phase patterns in monkey primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices. We observe that patterns correlate with the beta amplitude (envelope): Coherent planar/radial wave propagation accelerates with growing amplitude, and synchronized patterns are observed at largest amplitudes. In contrast, incoherent random or circular patterns are observed almost exclusively when beta is strongly attenuated. The occurrence probability of a particular pattern modulates with behavioral epochs in the same way as beta amplitude: Coherent patterns are more present during movement preparation where amplitudes are large, while incoherent phase patterns are dominant during movement execution where amplitudes are small. Thus, we uncover a trigonal link between the spatial arrangement of beta phases, beta amplitude, and behavior. Together with previous findings, we discuss predictions on the spatio-temporal organization of precisely coordinated spiking on the mesoscopic scale as a function of beta power.},

Increasing the number of simultaneously recorded neurons increases the chances to detect cell assembly activity due to the larger sample size. Recent technological advances have enabled the recording of 100 or more neurons in parallel. However, these massively parallel spike train data require novel statistical tools to be analyzed for correlations, because they raise considerable combinatorial and multiple testing issues. Recently, various of such methods have started to develop. First approaches were based on population or pairwise measures of synchronization, and later led to methods for the detection of various types of higher-order synchronization and of spatio-temporal patterns. The latest techniques combine data mining with analysis of statistical significance. Here, we give a comparative overview of these methods, of their assumptions and of the types of correlations they can detect.},

	abstract = {With the ability to observe the activity from large numbers of neurons simultaneously using modern recording technologies, the chance to identify sub-networks involved in coordinated processing increases. Sequences of synchronous spike events (SSEs) constitute one type of such coordinated spiking that propagates activity in a temporally precise manner. The synfire chain was proposed as one potential model for such network processing. Previous work introduced a method for visualization of SSEs in massively parallel spike trains, based on an intersection matrix that contains in each entry the degree of overlap of active neurons in two corresponding time bins. Repeated SSEs are reflected in the matrix as diagonal structures of high overlap values. The method as such, however, leaves the task of identifying these diagonal structures to visual inspection rather than to a quantitative analysis. Here we present ASSET (Analysis of Sequences of Synchronous EvenTs), an improved, fully automated method which determines diagonal structures in the intersection matrix by a robust mathematical procedure. The method consists of a sequence of steps that i) assess which entries in the matrix potentially belong to a diagonal structure, ii) cluster these entries into individual diagonal structures and iii) determine the neurons composing the associated SSEs. We employ parallel point processes generated by stochastic simulations as test data to demonstrate the performance of the method under a wide range of realistic scenarios, including different types of non-stationarity of the spiking activity and different correlation structures. Finally, the ability of the method to discover SSEs is demonstrated on complex data from large network simulations with embedded synfire chains. Thus, ASSET represents an effective and efficient tool to analyze massively parallel spike data for temporal sequences of synchronous activity.},

	abstract = {The computational role of spike time synchronization at millisecond precision among neurons in the cerebral cortex is hotly debated. Studies performed on data of limited size provided experimental evidence that low-order correlations occur in relation to behavior. Advances in electrophysiological technology to record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously provide the opportunity to observe coordinated spiking activity of larger populations of cells. We recently published a method that combines data mining and statistical evaluation to search for significant patterns of synchronous spikes in massively parallel spike trains (Torre et al., 2013). The method solves the computational and multiple testing problems raised by the high dimensionality of the data. In the current study, we used our method on simultaneous recordings from two macaque monkeys engaged in an instructed-delay reach-to-grasp task to determine the emergence of spike synchronization in relation to behavior. We found a multitude of synchronous spike patterns aligned in both monkeys along a preferential mediolateral orientation in brain space. The occurrence of the patterns is highly specific to behavior, indicating that different behaviors are associated with the synchronization of different groups of neurons ({\textquotedblleft}cell assemblies{\textquotedblright}). However, pooled patterns that overlap in neuronal composition exhibit no specificity, suggesting that exclusive cell assemblies become active during different behaviors, but can recruit partly identical neurons. These findings are consistent across multiple recording sessions analyzed across the two monkeys.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons in the brain communicate via electrical impulses called spikes. How spikes are coordinated to process information is still largely unknown. Synchronous spikes are effective in triggering a spike emission in receiving neurons and have been shown to occur in relation to behavior in a number of studies on simultaneous recordings of few neurons. We recently published a method to extend this type of investigation to larger data. Here, we apply it to simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons from the motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a motor task. Our analysis reveals groups of neurons selectively synchronizing their activity in relation to behavior, which sheds new light on the role of synchrony in information processing in the cerebral cortex.},

	abstract = {Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep structures1,2. Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging3,4,5 offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal{\textendash}oxide{\textendash}semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN6 sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70 {\texttimes} 20-$\mu$m cross-section shank. The 6 {\texttimes} 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.},

Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories{\textemdash}Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA){\textemdash}which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to GPFA. From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that GPFA performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.},

	abstract = {An important prerequisite for the analysis of spike synchrony in extracellular recordings is the extraction of single-unit activity from the multi-unit signal. To identify single units, potential spikes are separated with respect to their potential neuronal origins ('spike sorting'). However, different sorting algorithms yield inconsistent unit assignments, which seriously influences subsequent spike train analyses. We aim to identify the best sorting algorithm for subthalamic nucleus recordings of patients with Parkinson's disease (experimental data ED). Therefore, we apply various prevalent algorithms offered by the 'Plexon Offline Sorter' and evaluate the sorting results. Since this evaluation leaves us unsure about the best algorithm, we apply all methods again to artificial data (AD) with known ground truth. AD consists of pairs of single units with different shape similarity embedded in the background noise of the ED. The sorting evaluation depicts a significant influence of the respective methods on the single unit assignments. We find a high variability in the sortings obtained by different algorithms that increases with single units shape similarity. We also find significant differences in the resulting firing characteristics. We conclude that Valley-Seeking algorithms produce the most accurate result if the exclusion of artifacts as unsorted events is important. If the latter is less important ('clean' data) the K-Means algorithm is a better option. Our results strongly argue for the need of standardized validation procedures based on ground truth data. The recipe suggested here is simple enough to become a standard procedure.},

Motor control can be hierarchically characterized as the selection and planning of discrete movement classes and/or postures followed by the execution of continuous limb trajectories. Based on simultaneous recordings in primary motor (MI) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortices in behaving monkeys, we demonstrate that an MI ensemble can reconstruct hand or joint trajectory more accurately than an equally sized PMd ensemble. In contrast, PMd can more precisely predict the future occurrence of one of several discrete targets to be reached. This double dissociation suggests that a general-purpose BMI could take advantage of multiple cortical areas to control a wider variety of motor actions. These results also support the hierarchical view that MI ensembles are involved in lower-level movement execution, whereas PMd populations represent the early intention to move to visually presented targets.},

In a series of five acute experiments, 58.6\% of the electrodes in the array were found to be capable of recording visually evoked responses. In the most recent acute study, the average signal-to-noise ratio for recordings obtained from 56 of the electrodes in the array was calculated to be 5.5:1. Using standard window discrimination techniques, an average of 3.4 separable spikes were identified for each of these electrodes. In order to compare the two-dimensional mapping capabilities of the array with those derived from other technologies, orientation preference and ocular dominance maps were generated for each of the evoked responses. Histological evaluation of the implant site indicates some localized tissue insult, but this is likely due to the perfusion procedure since high signal-to-noise ratio neural responses were recorded. The recording capabilities of the Utah Intracortical Electrode Array in combination with the large number of electrodes available for recording make the array a tool well suited for investigations into the parallel processing mechanisms in cortex.},

	abstract = {Grasping an object involves shaping the hand and fingers in relation to the object's physical properties. Following object contact, it also requires a fine adjustment of grasp forces for secure manipulation. Earlier studies suggest that the control of hand shaping and grasp force involve partially segregated motor cortical networks. However, it is still unclear how information originating from these networks is processed and integrated. We addressed this issue by analyzing massively parallel signals from population measures (local field potentials, LFPs) and single neuron spiking activities recorded simultaneously during a delayed reach-to-grasp task, by using a 100-electrode array chronically implanted in monkey motor cortex. Motor cortical LFPs exhibit a large multi-component movement-related potential (MRP) around movement onset. Here, we show that the peak amplitude of each MRP component and its latency with respect to movement onset vary along the cortical surface covered by the array. Using a comparative mapping approach, we suggest that the spatio-temporal structure of the MRP reflects the complex physical properties of the reach-to-grasp movement. In addition, we explored how the spatio-temporal structure of the MRP relates to two other measures of neuronal activity: the temporal profile of single neuron spiking activity at each electrode site and the somatosensory receptive field properties of single neuron activities. We observe that the spatial representations of LFP and spiking activities overlap extensively and relate to the spatial distribution of proximal and distal representations of the upper limb. Altogether, these data show that, in motor cortex, a precise spatio-temporal pattern of activation is involved for the control of reach-to-grasp movements and provide some new insight about the functional organization of motor cortex during reaching and object manipulation.},

	abstract = {Multiple-electrode arrays are valuable both as a research tool and as a sensor for neuromotor prosthetic devices, which could potentially restore voluntary motion and functional independence to paralyzed humans. Long-term array reliability is an important requirement for these applications. Here, we demonstrate the reliability of a regular array of 100 microelectrodes to obtain neural recordings from primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys for at least three months and up to 1.5 years. We implanted Bionic (Cyberkinetics, Inc., Foxboro, MA) silicon probe arrays in MI of three Macaque monkeys. Neural signals were recorded during performance of an eight-direction, push-button task. Recording reliability was evaluated for 18, 35, or 51 sessions distributed over 83, 179, and 569 days after implantation, respectively, using qualitative and quantitative measures. A four-point signal quality scale was defined based on the waveform amplitude relative to noise. A single observer applied this scale to score signal quality for each electrode. A mean of 120 (/spl plusmn/17.6 SD), 146 (/spl plusmn/7.3), and 119 (/spl plusmn/16.9) neural-like waveforms were observed from 65-85 electrodes across subjects for all recording sessions of which over 80\% were of high quality. Quantitative measures demonstrated that waveforms had signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 20 with maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of over 1200 /spl mu/v with a mean SNR of 4.8 for signals ranked as high quality. Mean signal quality did not change over the duration of the evaluation period (slope 0.001, 0.0068 and 0.03; NS). By contrast, neural waveform shape varied between, but not within days in all animals, suggesting a shifting population of recorded neurons over time. Arm-movement related modulation was common and 66\% of all recorded neurons were tuned to reach direction. The ability for the array to record neural signals from parietal cortex was also established. These results demonstrate that neural recordings that can provide movement related signals for neural prostheses, as well as for fundamental research applications, can be reliably obtained for long time periods using a monolithic microelectrode array in primate MI and potentially from other cortical areas as well.},

The preparation of post-mortem brains for PLI involves fixation, freezing and cutting into 100-micrometer thick sections. Hence, geometrical distortions of histological sections are inevitable and have to be removed for 3D reconstruction and subsequent fibre tracking. We here present a processing pipeline for 3D reconstruction of these sections using PLI derived multimodal images of post-mortem brains. Blockface images of the brains were obtained during cutting; they serve as reference data for alignment and elimination of distortion artefacts. In addition to the spatial image transformation, fibre orientation vectors were reoriented using the transformation fields, which consider both affine and subsequent non-linear registration. The application of this registration and reorientation approach results in a smooth fibre vector field, which reflects brain morphology. PLI combined with 3D reconstruction and fibre tracking is a powerful tool for human brain mapping. It can also serve as an independent method for evaluating in vivo fibre tractography.},

	abstract = {Large-scale network dynamics in multiple visuomotor areas is of great interest in the study of eye-hand coordination in both human and monkey. To explore this, it is essential to develop a setup that allows for precise tracking of eye and hand movements. It is desirable that it is able to generate mechanical or visual perturbations of hand trajectories so that eye-hand coordination can be studied in a variety of conditions. There are simple solutions that satisfy these requirements for hand movements performed in the horizontal plane while visual stimuli and hand feedback are presented in the vertical plane. However, this spatial dissociation requires cognitive rules for eye-hand coordination different from eye-hand movements performed in the same space, as is the case in most natural conditions. Here we present an innovative solution for the precise tracking of eye and hand movements in a single reference frame. Importantly, our solution allows behavioral explorations under normal and perturbed conditions in both humans and monkeys. It is based on the integration of two noninvasive commercially available systems to achieve online control and synchronous recording of eye (EyeLink) and hand (KINARM) positions during interactive visuomotor tasks. We also present an eye calibration method compatible with different eye trackers that compensates for nonlinearities caused by the system's geometry. Our setup monitors the two effectors in real time with high spatial and temporal resolution and simultaneously outputs behavioral and neuronal data to an external data acquisition system using a common data format.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We developed a new setup for studying eye-hand coordination in humans and monkeys that monitors the two effectors in real time in a common reference frame. Our eye calibration method allows us to track gaze positions relative to visual stimuli presented in the horizontal workspace of the hand movements. This method compensates for nonlinearities caused by the system{\textquoteright}s geometry and transforms kinematics signals from the eye tracker into the same coordinate system as hand and targets.},

	abstract = {Primaten besitzen unter nat{\"u}rlichen Bedingungen eine bemerkenswerte Koordination von K{\"o}rperbewegungen als Reaktion auf hoch komplexe sensorische Informationen aus der externen Umgebung. Der Zustand unseres eigenen K{\"o}rpers und der der Objekte mit denen wir interagieren variiert mit der Zeit, jedoch erlaubt uns eine gleichzeitige Anpassung unserer Bewegungen ein gleichm{\"a}{\ss}iges, effizientes und Zielgerichtetes Verhalten. Eine Schl{\"u}sselkomponente dieses Verhaltens ist die Auge-Hand-Koordination. Die Erforschung der neuronalen Grundlagen und Prinzipien eines solchen Koordinationsverhalten involviert die Untersuchung von multiplen Arealen des Gehirns zust{\"a}ndig f{\"u}r Aufmerksamkeit, visuelle Verarbeitung, visuomotor Integration, Bewegungsplanung und -kontrolle. Diese Notwendigkeit f{\"u}hrte zur Entstehung eines speziellen neurowissenschaftlichen Bereichs, welcher sich zur Aufgabe gesetzt hat in Isolation die Anteile jedes respektiven Areals zu visuell-kontrollierten Bewegungsabl{\"a}ufen zu untersuchen. Allerdings reduziert diese Vorgehensweise, die die individuellen Systeme ohne deren synergetischen Zusammenhang betrachtet, unseren Einblick, weil isoliertes Verhalten von {\quotedblbase}unabh{\"a}ngigen{\textquotedblleft} Gehirnregionen eher selten ist. Das Hauptziel dieser Doktorarbeit ist multi-areale Koordination durch Ziel gerichtetes Verhalten aufzukl{\"a}ren und neue Einblicke in die dynamischen Prozesse von kontinuierlichen Vorhersagen und Transformationen zwischen sensorischen und motorischen Arealen zu schaffen. Die Frage wie sich visuelle und motorische Areale miteinander koordinieren, ben{\"o}tigt einen experimentellen Aufbau mit einer aufwendigen Verhaltenskontrolle, Aufnahmekapazit{\"a}ten mit multiplen Effektoren, und dichten elektrophysiologischen Aufnahmen in verschiedenen relevanten Gehirnstrukturen. In meiner Arbeit beginne ich zun{\"a}chst damit die Aspekte von visuell-gesteuertem Motorverhalten darzustellen und klassische und moderne Ideen zu pr{\"a}sentieren, die erkl{\"a}ren wie visuelle Stimuli von der Retina parallel {\"u}ber eine Vielfalt von Gehirnarealen geleitet werden und dabei mehrere Bezugsrahmen durchwandern um sp{\"a}ter die Motorik der Handbewegung zu kontrollieren. Ich f{\"u}hre nacheinander im Detail auf wie man einen Echtzeit integrierten visuomotorischen Verhaltens und elektrophysiologischen Aufnahmeaufbau (Real-time Integrated Visuomotor behavior \& Electrophysiology Recording; RIVER) entwickelt und dessen Einstellungen testet. Dieser Aufbau musste dabei die folgenden Bedingungen erf{\"u}llen: 1) Beide Augen und Hand Positionen musste im gleichen Koordinatensystem darzustellen sein; 2) Der Aufbau musste innerhalb der Aufgabenumgebung in Echtzeit Kontrolle {\"u}ber Augen und Handbewegungen behalten; 3) Bewegungen m{\"u}ssen unter jeglichen experimentellen Bedingung kontinuierlich verfolgt und aufgezeichnet werden k{\"o}nnen; 4) der Aufbau muss so optimiert sein, dass elektorphysiologische Aufzeichnungen bei menschlichen Teilnehmern und Affen m{\"o}glich sind; und 5) der Aufbau muss die M{\"o}glichkeit besitzen Daten des Verhaltens und allen experimentellen Events mit allen elektrophysiologischen Signalen synchron aufzuzeichnen. Ich pr{\"a}sentiere zudem vorl{\"a}ufige Verhaltensdaten eines Affen, der in einer sequenziellen Zeige Aufgabe im RIVER Aufbau trainiert wurde, und diskutiere kurz die chirurgischen Prozeduren und das Resultat der Implantation des Multi-Elektroden-Arrays (MEA). Zum Schluss pr{\"a}sentiere ich die Ergebnisse der Noise-Korrelationsanalyse der massiv-parallelen elektrophysiologischen Daten eines parallel durchgef{\"u}hrten Greif-Experiments (reach-to-grasp project). In natural conditions, primates possess a remarkable coordination of body movements in response to highly complex sensory information from the external world. The properties of our own body and those of the objects we interact with vary over time, yet continuous online adjustments allow for movements to be combined into a smooth and efficient goal-directed behavior. A key contribution to this behavior comes from eye-hand coordination. Studying the neural underpinnings of such coordinated behaviors involves attention, visual processing, visuomotor integration, motor planning and motor control in multiple areas across the brain. This distribution has led to specialized fields in neuroscience that aim to elucidate the contribution of each respective field to visually-guided motor behavior in isolation. However, studying individual systems without taking into account their synergistic relationships diminishes our insight, as isolated behaviors in arguably independent regions of the brain are limited. The main goal of this thesis is to elucidate multi-area coordination during goal-directed behavior and provide new insights into the dynamic processes of continuous predictions and transformations from sensory to motor areas (and back). The questions on how the visual input areas and motor output areas coordinate require an experimental setup with extensive behavioral control, recording capacity of multiple effectors, and dense electrophysiological recordings in multiple relevant brain structures. In my thesis I begin by outlining aspects of visually-guided motor behavior and present classic and current ideas on how the visual input on the retina travels in parallel through a multitude of brain areas, experiencing several stages of reference frame transformation, in order to control motor output of the hand. I subsequently detail the development and testing parameters of the Real-time Integrated Visuomotor behavior \& Electrophysiology Recording (RIVER) setup. This setup had to fulfill the following requirements: 1) both eye and hand positions must be expressed in the same coordinate space; 2) the setup must have real-time control over eye and hand movements within the task environment, 3) movements must be continuously tracked and recorded under any experimental condition, 4) the setup must be optimized to allow for electrophysiological recordings in human/monkey participants, and 5) the setup must have the ability to output synchronized data of behavioral and experimental events with all electrophysiological recordings. I present preliminary behavioral data from a monkey trained to perform a sequential point task in the RIVER setup, and briefly discuss the surgical procedures and outcome of multi-electrode array (MEA) implantation. Finally, I present our findings from noise correlation analysis on massively parallel electrophysiology data from a parallel reach-to-grasp project. de Haan, Marcel Jan; Gr{\"u}n, Sonja; Kampa, Bj{\"o}rn Michael; Riehle, Alexa},

	abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isn{\textquoteright}t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn{\textquoteright}t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with  Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code {\textquotedblleft}on the fly{\textquotedblright} into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer{\textemdash}but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You{\textquoteright}ll be reading code{\textemdash}lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what{\textquoteright}s right about that code, and what{\textquoteright}s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.   Clean Code  is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code{\textemdash}of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and {\textquotedblleft}smells{\textquotedblright} gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding  How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

	abstract = {Objective
Like all scientific research, computational neuroscience research
must be reproducible. Big data science, including simulation research,
cannot depend exclusively on journal articles as the method to provide the
sharing and transparency required for reproducibility.

Methods
Ensuring model reproducibility requires the use of multiple standard
software practices and tools, including version control, strong commenting
and documentation, and code modularity.

Results
Building on these standard practices, model sharing sites and tools
have been developed that fit into several categories: 1. standardized neural
simulators, 2. shared computational resources, 3. declarative model
descriptors, ontologies and standardized annotations; 4. model sharing
repositories and sharing standards.

Conclusion
A number of complementary innovations have been proposed to enhance
sharing, transparency and reproducibility. The individual user can be
encouraged to make use of version control, commenting, documentation and
modularity in development of models. The community can help by requiring
model sharing as a condition of publication and funding.

Significance
Model management will become increasingly important as multiscale
models become larger, more detailed and correspondingly more difficult to
manage by any single investigator or single laboratory. Additional
big data management complexity will come as the models
become more useful in interpreting experiments, thus increasing the need to
ensure clear alignment between modeling data, both parameters and results,
and experiment.},

We suggest that Make represents a large step towards these features with only a modest increase in programming demands over shell scripts. This approach reduces the technical skill and time required to write, debug, and maintain neuroimaging workflows in a dynamic environment, where pipelines are often modified to accommodate new best practices or to study the effect of alternative preprocessing steps, and where the underlying packages change frequently.

Reconstructed files, however, require adequate metadata to identify the appropriate animal species, developmental stage, brain region, and neuron type. Moreover, experimental details about tissue processing, neurite visualization and microscopic imaging are essential to assess the information content of digital morphologies. Typical morphological reconstructions only partially capture the underlying biological reality. Tracings are often limited to certain domains (e.g., dendrites and not axons), may be incomplete due to tissue sectioning, imperfect staining, and limited imaging resolution, or can disregard aspects irrelevant to their specific scientific focus (such as branch thickness or depth). Gauging these factors is critical in subsequent data reuse and comparison. NeuroMorpho.Org is a central repository of reconstructions from many laboratories and experimental conditions. Here, we introduce substantial additions to the existing metadata annotation aimed to describe the completeness of the reconstructed neurons in NeuroMorpho.Org.

Negatively, if a dataset doesn{\textquoteright}t fit within the criteria to meet the {\textquotedblleft}academic publication{\textquotedblright} mould (e.g. because it is being continually versioned and updated, or it is still being collected and will be for decades) it might be considered to be of less value to the community.

It is often said that {\textquotedblleft}all models are wrong, but some are useful{\textquotedblright} (Box, 1979). Hence we need to determine the usefulness and limits of models and metaphors, especially when trying to develop new processes and systems.~

This paper further develops the metaphors outlined in Parsons and Fox (2013), and gives real world examples of the metaphors from scientific data stored in the Centre for Environmental~Data Analysis (CEDA) {\textendash} a discipline-specific environmental data repository, and the processes that created the datasets.},

	abstract = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

Plenty of books describe what agile development is or why it helps software projects succeed, but very few combine information for developers, managers, testers, and customers into a single package that they can apply directly.This book provides no-nonsense advice on agile planning, development, delivery, and management taken from the authors' many years of experience with Extreme Programming (XP). You get a gestalt view of the agile development process, including comprehensive guidance for non-technical readers and hands-on technical practices for developers and testers.The Art of Agile Development gives you clear answers to questions such as:How can we adopt agile development?Do we really need to pair program?What metrics should we report?What if I can't get my customer to participate?How much documentation should we write?When do we design and architect?As a non-developer, how should I work with my agile team?Where is my product roadmap?How does QA fit in?The book teaches you how to adopt XP practices, describes each practice in detail, then discusses principles that will allow you to modify XP and create your own agile method. In particular, this book tackles the difficult aspects of agile development: the need for cooperation and trust among team members.Whether you're currently part of an agile team, working with an agile team, or interested in agile development, this book provides the practical tips you need to start practicing agile development. As your experience grows, the book will grow with you, providing exercises and information that will teach you first to understand the rules of agile development, break them, and ultimately abandon rules altogether as you master the art of agile development."Jim Shore and Shane Warden expertly explain the practices and benefits of Extreme Programming. They offer advice from their real-world experiences in leading teams. They answer questions about the practices and show contraindications - ways that a practice may be mis-applied. They offer alternatives you can try if there are impediments to applying a practice, such as the lack of an on-site customer.--Ken Pugh, Author of Jolt Award Winner, Prefactoring"I will leave a copy of this book with every team I visit."--Brian Marick, Exampler Consulting},

	abstract = {Data interoperability between well-defined domains is currently performed by leveraging Web services. In the biosciences, more specifically in neuroscience, robust data interoperability is more difficult to achieve due to data heterogeneity, continuous domain changes, and the constant creation of new semantic data models (Nadkarni et al., J Am Med Inform Assoc 6, 478-93, 1999; Miller et al., J Am Med Inform Assoc 8, 34-48, 2001; Gardner et al., J Am Med Inform Assoc 8, 17-33, 2001). Data heterogeneity in neurosciences is primarily due to its multidisciplinary nature. This results in a compelling need to integrate all available neuroscience information to improve our understanding of the brain. Researchers associated with neuroscience initiatives such as the human brain project (HBP) (Koslow and Huerta, Neuroinformatics: An Overview of the Human Brain Project, 1997), the Bioinformatics Research Network (BIRN), and the Neuroinformatics Information Framework (NIF) are exploring mechanisms to allow robust interoperability between these continuously evolving neuroscience databases. To accomplish this goal, it is crucial to orchestrate technologies such as database mediators, metadata repositories, semantic metadata annotations, and ontological services. This chapter introduces the importance of database interoperability in neurosciences. We also describe current data sharing and integration mechanisms in genera. We conclude with data integration in bioscience and present approaches on neuroscience data sharing.},

Neuroinformatics evaluates scientific needs and develops solutions to facilitate the use of data across the cognitive and neurosciences. For example, electronic data capture and management tools designed to facilitate human neurocognitive research can decrease the setup time of studies, improve quality control, and streamline the process of harmonizing, curating, and sharing data across data repositories.

The exchange of neuroscience data and tools between groups affords the opportunity to differently re-analyze previously collected data, encourage new neuroscience interpretations and foster otherwise uninitiated collaborations, and provide a framework for the further development of theoretically based models of brain function. Data sharing will ultimately reduce experimental and analytical error. Many small Internet accessible database initiatives have been developed and specialized analytical software and modeling tools are distributed within different fields of neuroscience. However, in addition large-scale international collaborations are required which involve new mechanisms of coordination and funding. Provided sufficient government support is given to such international initiatives, sharing of neuroscience data and tools can play a pivotal role in human brain research and lead to innovations in neuroscience, informatics and treatment of brain disorders. These innovations will enable application of theoretical modeling techniques to enhance our understanding of the integrative aspects of neuroscience.

Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard {\textquoteleft}open-loop{\textquoteright} visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.},

	issn = {1522-1598},
	doi = {10.1152/jn.00123.2019},
	abstract = {It is tempting to describe human reach-to-grasp movements in terms of two, more or less independent visuomotor channels, one relating hand transport to the object's location and the other relating grip aperture to the object's size. Our review of experimental work questions this framework for reasons that go beyond noting the dependence between the two channels. Both the lack of effect of size illusions on grip aperture and the finding that the variability in grip aperture does not depend on the object's size indicate that size information is not used to control grip aperture. An alternative is to describe grip formation as emerging from controlling the movements of the digits in space. Each digit's trajectory when grasping an object is remarkably similar to its trajectory when moving to tap the same position on its own. The similarity is also evident in the fast responses when the object is displaced. This review develops a new description of the speed-accuracy trade-off for multiple effectors that is applied to grasping. The most direct support for the digit-in-space framework is that prism-induced adaptation of each digit's tapping movements transfers to that digit's movements when grasping, leading to changes in grip aperture for adaptation in opposite directions for the two digits. We conclude that although grip aperture and hand transport are convenient variables to describe grasping, treating grasping as movements of the digits in space is a more suitable basis for understanding the neural control of grasping.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the influence of age and visual occlusion on fast reach-to-grasp movements. The effect of visual occlusion on reach-to-grasp movement was examined using a task that heavily relies on feed-forward control. Three groups of healthy adults aged 22, 49 and 65 on average performed fast reach-to-grasp movements with full visual and partial visual occlusion conditions of the hand during the initial part of movement. Regarding the effect of age, the all parameters of reach-to-grasp movement were deteriorated with age, except relative time to maximum velocity and spatial coordination. Regarding the effect of visual condition, participants reached with prolonged movement time, lower peak velocity, and later occurrences of peak velocity and peak aperture, as well as decrease in spatial coordination. Regarding the effect of age on visual condition, visual occlusion resulted in a longer movement time and delayed time to maximum velocity in middle-aged and older groups compared to full vision, but the difference was not observed in the younger groups. Conclusion: Reach-to-grasp performance deteriorated with age and the performance was affected when vision of the hand at initial movement was occluded. Overall, movement performance in middle-aged and older adults was affected by visual occlusion, whereas it was unaffected in younger adults. The results indicate that visual feedback of the hand at initial movement is important to control reach-to-grasp movement of middle-aged and older adults during real tasks.},
