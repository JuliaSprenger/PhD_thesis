	abstract = {As neuroscientists, we are obligated to guarantee the reliability of our research workflows and results.For this reason, most neuroscientific, peer-reviewed journals require, besides a full description of thenew scientific findings and used methods, at least also a brief summary of the used data. For a completelyopen scientific inquiry and to further promote scientific progress as required by most nationalfunding agencies, it would be best to share the raw data along with an analysis paper or independentlyas a standalone data publication. Unfortunately, especially the neuroscientific community ishesitant to share own research data with third parties, because guidelines, tools and support for thepublishing authors to provide data and corresponding adequate information on the experiment aregenerally hard to formalize and often missing. As a consequence, published scientific results remainunreproducible by other researchers. Along an example of a complex electrophysiological experimentwhich was conducted by external collaboration partners, I will demonstrate how to share and publishdata, but also identify the reasons why researchers, in particular experimentalists in electrophysiology,are hesitant to try the same. For this, I first provide a data descriptor of the experiment following theguidelines of a pure data journal from the Nature publishing group, called Scientific Data. Accordingto the journal guidelines, I describe all information necessary to be able to understand the setupand workflow of the experiment as well as the minimum information necessary to be able to workwith the corresponding datasets. The latter requires the provision of a robust data loading routine.To guarantee the access to the data of the experiment, I implemented a commonly usable loadingroutine for the data formats of the used data acquisition (DAQ) system from Blackrock Microsystems(Cerebus DAQ), and published it as part of an open source data framework, called Neo. Neo hasthe advantage of representing data in standardized structures that allow researchers to use commonanalysis routines on different data formats. In addition, it is possible to further annotate the Neo datastructures with experiment-specific information on the data. To automatically integrate such information,termed metadata, it is best to have them organised in a machine-readable format. Althoughseveral software solutions for such metadata formats exist, they are usually not tested for complexuse cases, such as the example experiment. In most cases, they only provide the framework itself as astandardized metadata representation or specification, and no solutions for how to actually compile auseful metadata collection. For the example experiment, I chose a metadata framework, called openmetadata Markup Language (odML), an open source project developed by the German Node (GNode)of the International Neuroinformatics Coordination Facility (INCF). In the second part of thethesis, I demonstrate how to organize metadata for the experiment, to be able to compile and use acorresponding odML metadata collection. To facilitate the compilation process for my collaborators, Ideveloped a Python package, called odMLtables, which facilitates the access to the odML frameworkby an algorithmic transformation of odML into a spreadsheet format (csv or xls) and back. In addition,I provided a complete workflow for collecting and storing the metadata of the experiment intoa comprehensive odML-file collection. Furthermore, I provided a specified data loading routine thatautomatically annotates the data structures with the corresponding metadata of the collection. Thelatter improves the workflow in the course of neuroscientific analyses of the data from the exampleexperiment, as demonstrated in the last part of my thesis. In summary, I show that the preparationsto properly share research data within a scientific collaboration are cumbersome and time consuming,but essential for successfully publishing data and analysis results for a broader audience of users. Topromote data sharing within the neuroscientific community and to provide a better foundation forreproducible research, my thesis offers a coherent strategy for managing electrophysiological data andmetadata using a well selected set of available technologies},

	abstract = {In a typical electrophysiological experiment, especially one that includes studying animal behavior, the data collected normally contain spikes, local field potentials, behavioral responses and other associated data. In order to obtain informative results, the data must be analyzed simultaneously with the experimental settings. However, most open-source toolboxes currently available for data analysis were developed to handle only a portion of the data and did not take into account the sorting of experimental conditions. Additionally, these toolboxes require that the input data be in a specific format, which can be inconvenient to users. Therefore, the development of a highly integrated toolbox that can process multiple types of data regardless of input data format and perform basic analysis for general electrophysiological experiments is incredibly useful.},

Here we present a useful step towards achieving this aim: simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. The primary challenge of this method is removing an electrical artifact from the MEA signals that is caused by the imaging laser. Here we show that artifact removal can be achieved with a simple filtering scheme. As a demonstration of this technique we compare large-scale local field potential signals to single-neuron activity in a small-scale group of cells recorded from rat acute slices under two conditions: suppressed vs. intact inhibitory interactions between neurons.},

CaImAn provides automatic and scalable methods to address problems common to pre-processing, including motion correction, neural activity identification, and registration across different sessions of data collection. It does this while requiring minimal user intervention, with good scalability on computers ranging from laptops to high-performance computing clusters. CaImAn is suitable for two-photon and one-photon imaging, and also enables real-time analysis on streaming data. To benchmark the performance of CaImAn we collected and combined a corpus of manual annotations from multiple labelers on nine mouse two-photon datasets. We demonstrate that CaImAn achieves near-human performance in detecting locations of active neurons.},

NSDF is designed to store simulator output across scales: from multiscale chemical and electrical signaling models, to detailed single-neuron and network models, to abstract neural nets. It is self-documenting, efficient, modular, and scalable, both in terms of novel data types and in terms of data volume. NSDF is simulator-independent, and can be used by a range of standalone analysis and visualization tools. It may also be used to store variety of experimental data. NSDF is based on the widely used HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) specification and is open, platform-independent, and portable.},

This study analyses the solutions offered by generalist scientific data repositories, i.e., repositories supporting the deposition of any type of research data. These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such repositories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset formatting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a context where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.},

Lately, data journals have overcome some of these barriers. In this study of more than 100 currently existing data journals, we describe the approaches they promote for data set description, availability, citation, quality, and open access.

	abstract = {The data underlying scientific papers should be accessible to researchers both now and in the future, but how best can we ensure that these data are available? Here we examine the effectiveness of four approaches to data archiving: no stated archiving policy, recommending (but not requiring) archiving, and two versions of mandating data deposition at acceptance. We control for differences between data types by trying to obtain data from papers that use a single, widespread population genetic analysis, structure. At one extreme, we found that mandated data archiving policies that require the inclusion of a data availability statement in the manuscript improve the odds of finding the data online almost 1000-fold compared to having no policy. However, archiving rates at journals with less stringent policies were only very slightly higher than those with no policy at all. We also assessed the effectiveness of asking for data directly from authors and obtained over half of the requested datasets, albeit with \~{}8 d delay and some disagreement with authors. Given the long-term benefits of data accessibility to the academic community, we believe that journal-based mandatory data archiving policies and mandatory data availability statements should be more widely adopted.{\textemdash}Vines, T.

	abstract = {Background Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. Methods and Findings We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. Conclusions We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

During category learning, humans group perceptual stimuli by abstracting qualities from similarity relationships of their physical properties1,2,8. Forming categories is fundamental to cognition9 and can be independent of a {\^a}{\texteuro}\~{}memory store{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} of information about the items or a prototype10. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the formation of categories are unknown. Using an animal model of category learning6, in which frequency-modulated tones are distinguished into the categories of {\^a}{\texteuro}\~{}rising{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} and {\^a}{\texteuro}\~{}falling{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} modulation, we demonstrate here that the sorting of stimuli into these categories emerges as a sudden change in an animal's learning strategy. Electro-corticographical recording from the auditory cortex11 shows that the transition is accompanied by a change in the dynamics of cortical stimulus representation. We suggest that this dynamic change represents a mechanism underlying the recognition of the abstract quality (or qualities) that defines the categories.},

	abstract = {Despite the increasingly digital nature of society there are some areas of research that remain firmly rooted in the past; in this case the laboratory notebook, the last remaining paper component of an experiment. Countless electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) have been created in an attempt to digitise record keeping processes in the lab, but none of them have become a `key player' in the ELN market, due to the many adoption barriers that have been identified in previous research and further explored in the user studies presented here. The main issues identified are the cost of the current available ELNs, their ease of use (or lack of it) and their accessibility issues across different devices and operating systems. Evidence suggests that whilst scientists willingly make use of generic notebooking software, spreadsheets and other general office and scientific tools to aid their work, current ELNs are lacking in the required functionality to meet the needs of the researchers. In this paper we present our extensive research and user study results to propose an ELN built upon a pre-existing cloud notebook platform that makes use of accessible popular scientific software and semantic web technologies to help overcome the identified barriers to adoption.},

Over 100 years our field qualitatively described and invasively manipulated single or few organisms to gain anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological insights. In the last 10 years neuroscience spawned quantitative datasets of unprecedented breadth (e.g., microanatomy, synaptic connections, and optogenetic brain-behavior assays) and size (e.g., cognition, brain imaging, and genetics). While growing data availability and information granularity have been amply discussed, we direct attention to a less explored question: How will the unprecedented data richness shape data analysis practices? Statistical reasoning is becoming more important to distill neurobiological knowledge from healthy and pathological brain measurements. We argue that large-scale data analysis will use more statistical models that are non-parametric, generative, and mixing frequentist and Bayesian aspects, while supplementing classical hypothesis testing with out-of-sample predictions.},

	abstract = {The whisker to barrel system in rodents has become one of the major models for the study of sensory processing. Several tens of whiskers (or vibrissae) are distributed in a regular manner on both sides of the snout. Many tactile discrimination tasks using this system need multiple contacts with more than one whisker to be solved. With the aim of mimicking those multi-whisker stimuli during electrophysiological recordings, we developed a novel mechanical stimulator composed of 24 independent multi-directional piezoelectric benders adapted to the five rows and the five caudal arcs of the rat whisker pad. The most widely used technology for producing mechanical deflections of the whiskers is based on piezoelectric benders that display a non-linear behavior when driven with high frequency input commands and, if not compensated, show high unwanted ringing at particular resonance frequencies. If not corrected, this nonlinear behavior precludes the application of high frequency deflections and the study of cortical responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. To cope with the ringing problem, a mechanical and a software based solutions have been developed. With these corrections, the upper bound of the linear range of the bender is increased to 1 kHz. This new device allows the controlled delivery of large scale natural patterns of whisker deflections characterized by rapid high frequency vibrations of multiple whiskers.},

	abstract = {Patch-clamp electrophysiology is widely used to characterize neuronal electrical phenotypes. However, there are no standard experimental conditions for in vitro whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, complicating direct comparisons between data sets. In this study, we sought to understand how basic experimental conditions differ among laboratories and how these differences might impact measurements of electrophysiological parameters. We curated the compositions of external bath solutions (artificial cerebrospinal fluid), internal pipette solutions, and other methodological details such as animal strain and age from 509 published neurophysiology articles studying rodent neurons. We found that very few articles used the exact same experimental solutions as any other, and some solution differences stem from recipe inheritance from advisor to advisee as well as changing trends over the years. Next, we used statistical models to understand how the use of different experimental conditions impacts downstream electrophysiological measurements such as resting potential and action potential width. Although these experimental condition features could explain up to 43\% of the study-to-study variance in electrophysiological parameters, the majority of the variability was left unexplained. Our results suggest that there are likely additional experimental factors that contribute to cross-laboratory electrophysiological variability, and identifying and addressing these will be important to future efforts to assemble consensus descriptions of neurophysiological phenotypes for mammalian cell types.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This article describes how using different experimental methods during patch-clamp electrophysiology impacts downstream physiological measurements. We characterized how methodologies and experimental solutions differ across articles. We found that differences in methods can explain some, but not all, of the study-to-study variance in electrophysiological measurements. Explicitly accounting for methodological differences using statistical models can help correct downstream electrophysiological measurements for cross-laboratory methodology differences.},
